# SenseNet-ImageManipulator-Application
One of my oldest code I've dragged from project to project is an "advanced" image resize application solution for sensenet. There were a watermark extension, but I don't find it. I've refactored and put this code to github to not lose it again. I hope will find the extensions.

# How it works
1. install the ctd to the system and deploy it's assembly
1. create an imagehandler application as appmodell application for Image types
1. use as appmodell action on images
